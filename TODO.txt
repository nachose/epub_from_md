-Right now, it only works because we don't have a deep hiherachy.
If instead we had more than level of directories for the md files, it would fails, as
it is failing for images.                                                                        [X]

-Change routes to images.                                                                        [X]

-Change headers, so that they inherit depth from parent.                                         [X]

-Add a title in the pandoc generation.                                                           [X]

-Add a stylesheet for better handling of spaces. Should have a new line after titles,
  after each paragraph, also after images.                                                       [X]

-Instead of passing around parameters, create a new class GenContext or something like that
 that contains all the data.

-Read the metadata header, and add it as header of the contents                                  [X]

-The code blocks should be syntax highlighted                                                    [X]
(The ones that are marked with a programming language are being syntax highlithed,
 those that are not marked, are not being highlighted)
