-Right now, it only works because we don't have a deep hiherachy.
If instead we had more than level of directories for the md files, it would fails, as
it is failing for images.

-Change routes to images.

-Change headers, so that they inherit depth from parent.

-Add a title in the pandoc generation.

-Add a stylesheet for better handling of spaces. Should have a new line after titles,
  after each paragraph, also after images.

-Instead of passing around parameters, create a new class GenContext or something like that
 that contains all the data.

-Read the metadata header, and add it as header of the contents
