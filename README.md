# Epub from markdown.
Try to create epubs from md documentation

## Dependencies.

It needs pandoc to work. Also it will use pandoc default css default page. If you want another style, you need to provide your own css. See pandoc documentation to find the route where to place your css.
It can be in several places. For example, I do have it in ~/.local/share/

## Usage

- Copy metadata_header.txt file to the root of your markdown. Edit the values if you want to
  change something.
